# Coding conventions

## Naming conventions

* class names in CamelCase that starts with a capital letter
* data members start with d_
* method parameters start with p_
* local variables start with l_
* global variables in capital letters
* static members start with a capital letter, non-static members start with a lower case letter
Code layout
* consistent layout throughout code (use an IDE auto-formatter)
## Commenting convention

* javadoc comments for every class and method
* long methods (more than 10 lines) are documented with comments for procedural steps
* no commented-out code
## Project structure
* one folder for every module in the high-level design
* tests are in a separate folder that has the exact same structure as the code folder
* 1-1 relationship between tested classes and test classes
